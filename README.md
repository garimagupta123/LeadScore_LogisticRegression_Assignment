## General Information
- Logistic regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module. 
- We are trying to provide scores to lead generated in X_Education based on probability of conversion. 
- The Lead score dataset is being used. 
- The dependent/target varibale in the data set is converted.


## Technologies Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- sci-kit learn
- numpy

## Conclusion
- Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity values of test set are around 81%, 80% and 82% which are approximately closer to the respective values calculated using trained set.
- Also the lead score calculated in the trained set of data shows the conversion rate on the final predicted model is around 81%
- Hence overall this model seems to be good.
